# Law-Corp MCP — Project Rules

> **See `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root for the full authoritative rule set.**

---

## Git

**Never create git commits.** Implement code, verify it, and hand off to the developer.

---

## Critical Code Conventions

### No Magic Strings for Tool Names

All MCP tool names are defined once in `src/LawCorp.Mcp.Core/McpToolName.cs` as `const string` fields.

```csharp
// ✅ CORRECT
[McpServerTool(Name = McpToolName.Cases.Search), Description("...")]

// ❌ WRONG
[McpServerTool(Name = "cases_search"), Description("...")]
```

Always use `McpToolName.X.Y` — never write raw tool name string literals anywhere in code.

### `McpServerToolAttribute.Name` Must Always Be Set

Do not rely on SDK PascalCase→snake_case convention. Always set `Name` explicitly from `McpToolName`.

### EF Core

- Never set explicit IDs for operational entities
- Use `ValueGeneratedNever()` only for reference/lookup data
- Load navigation properties explicitly before accessing them

### Config

- Use `appsettings.Development.json` (gitignored) + `.example` (tracked) pattern
- Never hardcode secrets or connection strings

## Project Management

Work items live in `proj-mgmt/epics/NN-slug/`. Always read the item file before implementing. Update `**Status:**` and check off acceptance criteria when done. See `CLAUDE.md` for full workflow rules.

---

## Communication

When SDK internals are hard to access (e.g., NuGet DLLs), ask the user directly instead of using decompilers or other indirect tools.

Default to updating local project rules (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/`) so other developers benefit — not global user config.
