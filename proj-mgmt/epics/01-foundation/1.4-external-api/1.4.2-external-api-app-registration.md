# 1.4.2: Define app registration and `api://` scope for external API

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Task
**Feature:** [1.4: External Downstream API Service](./1.4-external-api.md)
**Tags:** `+auth`
**Setup Guide:** [`docs/auth-config.md` — Step 11](../../../../docs/auth-config.md#step-11-configure-the-external-api)

---

- [ ] Create `LawCorp External API` app registration in Entra ID (single tenant)
- [ ] Set Application ID URI to `api://<external-api-client-id>`
- [ ] Expose delegated scopes: `data.read` and `data.write`
- [ ] Grant the MCP server app registration permission to the `data.read` and `data.write` scopes (with admin consent)
- [ ] Document the app registration in `docs/auth-config.md` Step 11

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] App registration exists in Entra ID with correct configuration
- [ ] Scopes are visible under **Expose an API** in the Azure Portal
- [ ] MCP server registration has API permissions for the external API scopes
- [ ] Admin consent is granted
- [ ] `docs/auth-config.md` Step 11a–11c are accurate and complete

## Notes

The external API does not need a client secret — it only validates inbound OBO tokens. It never initiates its own OBO exchange.
