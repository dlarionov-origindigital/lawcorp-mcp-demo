# 1.3.3: Implement field-level redaction

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Task
**Feature:** [1.3: Custom Authorization Layer](./1.3-authorization.md)
**Tags:** `+auth`

---

- [ ] Create redaction middleware/service that strips sensitive fields based on role
- [ ] Fields to redact: SSN, financial details, privileged notes
- [ ] Intern role sees redacted versions of documents and case details
- [ ] Redaction is applied at the DTO mapping layer

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Intern role receives redacted DTOs with sensitive fields removed
- [ ] Redaction is applied consistently at the DTO mapping layer, not ad-hoc
- [ ] Non-intern roles are unaffected by redaction logic

## Notes

Depends on 1.3.1 (role-based auth handler) for role resolution.
