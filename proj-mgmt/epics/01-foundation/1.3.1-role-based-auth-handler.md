# 1.3.1: Implement role-based authorization handler

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [1.3: Custom Authorization Layer](./1.3-authorization.md)
**Tags:** `+auth`

---

As a system administrator,
I want access to data controlled by user role,
So that interns can't see privileged case notes and associates can only access assigned cases.

- [ ] Implement `IAuthorizationHandler` for role-based access evaluation
- [ ] Map Entra ID roles to application permissions matrix (see PRD Section 4.2)
- [ ] Create authorization policies: `CanReadCase`, `CanUpdateCase`, `CanReadDocument`, `CanDraftDocument`, `CanLogTime`, `CanApproveIntake`, etc.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each role resolves to the correct set of authorization policies
- [ ] Authorization handler correctly evaluates each policy
- [ ] Unauthorized access results in appropriate denial response

## Notes

Depends on 1.2.1 (Entra ID auth middleware) for claim availability.
