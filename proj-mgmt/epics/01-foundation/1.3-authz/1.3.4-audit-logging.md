# 1.3.4: Implement audit logging for all data access

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Task
**Feature:** [1.3: Custom Authorization Layer](./1.3-authorization.md)
**Tags:** `+auth`

---

- [ ] Create `AuditLog` entity and EF Core configuration
- [ ] Intercept all data access via EF Core SaveChanges/query interceptors
- [ ] Log: UserId, UserRole, Action, EntityType, EntityId, Timestamp, Details, IpAddress
- [ ] Ensure audit log itself is append-only (no update/delete)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All data access operations are captured in the audit log
- [ ] Audit log is append-only — no rows can be updated or deleted
- [ ] Log entries include UserId, UserRole, Action, EntityType, EntityId, Timestamp, Details, and IpAddress

## Notes

The AuditLog entity is also defined in Epic 2 (2.6.4). This task covers the EF Core interceptor wiring and append-only enforcement, not the entity definition itself.
