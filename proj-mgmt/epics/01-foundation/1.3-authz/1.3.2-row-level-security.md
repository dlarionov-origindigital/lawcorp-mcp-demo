# 1.3.2: Implement row-level security via EF Core global query filters

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Task
**Feature:** [1.3: Custom Authorization Layer](./1.3-authorization.md)
**Tags:** `+auth`

---

- [ ] Configure EF Core global query filters scoped by user role and assignments
- [ ] Partner: filter to own practice group
- [ ] Associate: filter to assigned cases only
- [ ] Paralegal/Legal Assistant: filter to assigned attorney's cases
- [ ] Intern: filter to assigned cases with redaction flag

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Partner queries return only practice group data
- [ ] Associate queries return only assigned case data
- [ ] Paralegal and Legal Assistant queries are scoped to assigned attorney's cases
- [ ] Intern queries apply both case scope and redaction flag

## Notes

Depends on 1.3.1 (role-based auth handler) for role resolution.
