# 1.2: Authentication — Microsoft Entra ID

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Epic:** [Epic 1: Project Foundation & Infrastructure](./_epic.md)
**Goal:** Implement Microsoft Entra ID authentication middleware with OBO token exchange for downstream service access, using OAuth identity passthrough as the canonical user-delegated access pattern ([ADR-005](../../decisions/005-oauth-identity-passthrough.md)).

## Items

| [1.2.4](./1.2.4-downstream-resource-access/1.2.4-downstream-resource-access.md) | Downstream resource access via identity passthrough | Story | BACKLOG |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Valid Entra ID tokens are accepted
- [ ] Invalid/expired tokens return 401
- [ ] Claims are available in HttpContext for downstream use
- [ ] OBO flow passes caller identity to downstream services (Graph, SharePoint, Calendar)
- [ ] Local database access is scoped by the user's identity context
- [ ] Consent flow errors are surfaced as structured MCP responses
- [ ] App registration setup is documented
- [ ] Each persona role produces different access results for both Graph and local DB resources
