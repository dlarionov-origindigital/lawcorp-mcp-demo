# 1.2.2: Implement On-Behalf-Of (OBO) token exchange

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [1.2: Authentication — Microsoft Entra ID](./1.2-authentication.md)
**Tags:** `+auth`

---

As a Law-Corp attorney using an AI assistant,
I want my identity to flow through to downstream services,
So that I only see data I'm authorized to see.

- [ ] Implement OBO flow for downstream secured resource access
- [ ] Implement token caching strategy for OBO tokens
- [ ] Add error handling for consent/authorization failures

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Caller identity propagates to downstream services via OBO token
- [ ] OBO tokens are cached to avoid unnecessary round-trips
- [ ] Consent and authorization failures are handled gracefully

## Notes

Depends on 1.2.1 (Entra ID auth middleware) being complete.
