# 1.2.3: Set up Entra ID app registrations documentation

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Task
**Feature:** [1.2: Authentication — Microsoft Entra ID](./1.2-authentication.md)
**Tags:** `+auth`

---

- [ ] Document required app registrations (MCP server, client app)
- [ ] Document API permissions and scopes — include Graph scopes required for identity passthrough (see [ADR-005](../../decisions/005-oauth-identity-passthrough.md) and [1.2.4](./1.2.4-downstream-resource-access/1.2.4-downstream-resource-access.md))
- [ ] Document role definitions to be configured in Entra ID
- [ ] Document the Graph API delegated permissions: `User.Read`, `Calendars.Read`, `Calendars.ReadWrite`, `Sites.Read.All`, `Mail.Read` (minimum set; adjust per implemented tools)
- [ ] Document the OAuth identity passthrough configuration for Azure Foundry deployment (cross-reference [6.4.4](../06-protocol-deployment/6.4.4-foundry-oauth-passthrough-config.md))
- [ ] Provide a setup script or ARM/Bicep template for app registrations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] App registration documentation covers MCP server and client app registrations
- [ ] API permissions and scopes are fully documented, including Graph delegated scopes for OBO
- [ ] Role definitions match the application permissions matrix
- [ ] Foundry OAuth passthrough redirect URI is documented
- [ ] Setup script or ARM/Bicep template automates app registration creation

## Notes

ARM/Bicep template will also feed into Epic 6 deployment work.
Graph scopes should follow least-privilege per [ADR-005](../../decisions/005-oauth-identity-passthrough.md).
