# 1.1.3: Set up development environment configuration

**Status:** DONE
**Type:** Task
**Feature:** [1.1: Solution & Project Structure](./1.1-solution-structure.md)
**Tags:** `+foundation`

---

- [x] Create `appsettings.Development.json.example` with local SQL Express connection string template
- [x] Create `launchSettings.json` with dev profiles (Development and Production environments)
- [ ] Set up Docker Compose for local SQL Express (optional — deferred)
- [x] Write README with setup instructions (`src/README.md`, root `README.md`)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Developer can clone repo and run locally following the README
- [x] Local SQL Express connection is configured and documented
- [x] Dev profiles are available in `launchSettings.json`

## Notes

Docker Compose step is optional — deferred to a later iteration.

`appsettings.Development.json` is git-ignored. Developers copy `appsettings.Development.json.example` and fill in their local connection string.
