**Goal:** Establish comprehensive test coverage for the authorization layer, tool handlers, resources, and prompts.

> **Note:** This feature has been superseded in scope by [Epic 7: End-to-End Testing](../../07-testing/_epic.md), which provides a fully specified, persona-driven test suite with swappable DB and identity adapters. When Epic 7 is complete, mark this feature `DONE` by reference. The items below remain as a high-level checklist; detailed stories and tasks live in Epic 7.
