# 6.2.3: Implement progress reporting for long-running tools

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Task
**Feature:** [6.2: Cross-Cutting Protocol Features](./6.2-protocol-features.md)
**Tags:** `+protocol`

---

- [ ] Identify long-running tools: `clients_conflict_check`, `documents_draft`, `intake_run_conflict_check`, `intake_generate_engagement_letter`
- [ ] Implement MCP progress token protocol
- [ ] Report progress stages with descriptive messages (e.g., "Searching clients... 1/3", "Checking cases... 2/3", "Analyzing results... 3/3")
- [ ] Progress updates sent via `notifications/progress`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All four identified long-running tools emit progress notifications
- [ ] Each progress update includes a stage description and fraction (current/total)
- [ ] Progress notifications fire at meaningful stages, not on every row
- [ ] Tools complete normally even if the client ignores progress tokens
