# 6.5: Health Checks & Observability

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Epic:** [Epic 6: MCP Protocol Features & Deployment](../_epic.md)
**Goal:** Add ASP.NET Core health check endpoints and observability infrastructure to support Azure App Service monitoring, load balancer health probes, and platform health dashboards.

## Research

- [MCP Server Custom Endpoints & Azure App Service Health Checks](../../01-foundation/1.1-solution-structure/RESEARCH-mcp-server-custom-endpoints.md)

## Items

| ID | Title | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [6.5.1](./6.5.1-mcp-server-health-endpoints.md) | MCP Server health endpoints | Story | BACKLOG |
| [6.5.2](./6.5.2-external-api-health-endpoints.md) | External API health endpoints | Story | BACKLOG |
| [6.5.3](./6.5.3-mcp-endpoint-path.md) | Move MCP endpoint to `/api/mcp` | Story | BACKLOG |
| [6.5.4](./6.5.4-app-service-health-config.md) | Azure App Service health check configuration | Story | BACKLOG |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MCP Server exposes `/health` (liveness) and `/health/ready` (readiness) endpoints
- [ ] External API exposes `/health` (liveness) and `/health/ready` (readiness) endpoints
- [ ] Readiness probes validate SQL Server connectivity
- [ ] MCP Server readiness probe validates External API reachability
- [ ] MCP endpoint moved from root to `/api/mcp` with documentation updated
- [ ] Azure App Service health check path configured in Bicep/ARM
- [ ] Health check dashboard integration documented

## Notes

- Health endpoints must be **unauthenticated** — Azure App Service probes don't send auth headers
- The existing `HealthController` in External API should be replaced with ASP.NET Core `AddHealthChecks()` framework
- MCP endpoint path change (`/` → `/api/mcp`) is a breaking change for existing MCP Inspector and client configs
