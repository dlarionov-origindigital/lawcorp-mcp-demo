# 6.5.2: External API Health Endpoints

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [6.5 Health Checks & Observability](./6.5-health-observability.md)

## Goal

Replace the manual `HealthController` in the External API with the ASP.NET Core health check framework, adding readiness probes for the DMS database.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `HealthController` replaced with `AddHealthChecks()` + `MapHealthChecks()`
- [ ] `/health` endpoint returns 200 OK (liveness)
- [ ] `/health/ready` checks SQL Server (`LawCorpDms`) connectivity
- [ ] Health endpoints are unauthenticated
- [ ] Existing consumers of `/health` (MCP Server readiness probe) continue to work

## Tasks

1. Remove `HealthController.cs`
2. Register `AddHealthChecks().AddSqlServer(...)` in `Program.cs`
3. Map `/health` and `/health/ready` endpoints
4. Add tests
