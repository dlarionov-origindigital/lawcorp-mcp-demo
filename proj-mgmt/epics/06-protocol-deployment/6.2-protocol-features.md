# 6.2: Cross-Cutting Protocol Features

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Epic:** [Epic 6: MCP Protocol Features & Deployment](./_epic.md)
**Goal:** Implement structured logging, pagination, progress reporting, cancellation, and error handling across all tool handlers.

## Items

| ID | Title | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [6.2.1](./6.2.1-structured-logging.md) | Implement structured logging for all tool invocations | Story | BACKLOG |
| [6.2.2](./6.2.2-cursor-pagination.md) | Implement cursor-based pagination for all search/list tools | Task | BACKLOG |
| [6.2.3](./6.2.3-progress-reporting.md) | Implement progress reporting for long-running tools | Task | BACKLOG |
| [6.2.4](./6.2.4-cancellation-support.md) | Implement cancellation support | Task | BACKLOG |
| [6.2.5](./6.2.5-error-handling.md) | Implement structured error handling with MCP error codes | Task | BACKLOG |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every tool invocation produces a structured log entry
- [ ] All search/list tools return paginated results with cursors
- [ ] Long-running tools report progress via `notifications/progress`
- [ ] All long-running tools respect `CancellationToken`
- [ ] All application errors are mapped to appropriate MCP error codes
