# 6.2.1: Implement structured logging for all tool invocations

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [6.2: Cross-Cutting Protocol Features](./6.2-protocol-features.md)
**Tags:** `+protocol`

---

As an administrator,
I want structured logs for every tool invocation and authorization decision,
So that I can audit system usage and troubleshoot issues.

- [ ] Log tool name, parameters, user identity, authorization result, and execution time for every call
- [ ] Log authorization decisions (allowed/denied with reason)
- [ ] Use MCP logging protocol to send log messages to client
- [ ] Configurable log levels (debug, info, warning, error)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every tool invocation generates a structured log entry with all required fields
- [ ] Authorization decisions are logged separately with reason
- [ ] Log level is configurable without code changes
- [ ] Sensitive field values (e.g., document content) are redacted from logs
