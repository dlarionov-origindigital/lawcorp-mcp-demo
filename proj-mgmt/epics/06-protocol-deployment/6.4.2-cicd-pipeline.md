**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Task
**Feature:** [6.4: Deployment to Azure Foundry](./6.4-deployment.md)
**Tags:** `+deployment`

- [ ] Build pipeline: restore → build → test → publish
- [ ] Deploy pipeline: provision infrastructure → run migrations → deploy app
- [ ] Environment stages: dev → staging → production
- [ ] Automated testing gate before promotion to staging/production
- [ ] Notify on failure

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every push to `main` triggers the build pipeline
- [ ] Build pipeline fails if any test fails
- [ ] Promotion to staging requires passing all tests
- [ ] Promotion to production requires manual approval
- [ ] Pipeline is defined as code (YAML) in the repository
