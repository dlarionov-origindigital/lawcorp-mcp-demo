**Status:** BACKLOG

As a DevOps engineer,
I want the MCP server deployed to Azure Foundry,
So that the solution is accessible in a cloud environment.

- [ ] Create Azure Foundry project configuration
- [ ] Configure managed identity for Entra ID OBO flow
- [ ] Set up Azure SQL (or SQL Express equivalent) in Azure
- [ ] Configure environment variables and secrets (Key Vault or Foundry secrets)
- [ ] Set up health checks and readiness probes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MCP server starts and responds to protocol requests in Azure Foundry
- [ ] Managed identity resolves Entra ID tokens correctly (OBO flow works)
- [ ] Database connection uses managed identity (no connection string with credentials)
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200 when server is ready
- [ ] All secrets stored in Key Vault or Foundry secrets, not in config files
