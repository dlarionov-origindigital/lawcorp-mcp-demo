# 6.3.3: Write integration tests for MCP resources and prompts

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Task
**Feature:** [6.3: Testing](./6.3-testing.md)
**Tags:** `+protocol`

---

- [ ] Test static resource responses (correct content, correct MIME type)
- [ ] Test dynamic resource URI resolution (valid URI resolves, invalid URI returns error)
- [ ] Test subscription resource trigger conditions (update fires when expected entity changes)
- [ ] Test prompt materialization with various argument combinations
- [ ] Validate prompt output structure (required fields, correct content type)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every static resource has a test verifying its content and MIME type
- [ ] Every dynamic resource URI pattern has valid and invalid URI tests
- [ ] Every subscription resource has a trigger test
- [ ] Every prompt has at least one materialization test with typical arguments
- [ ] All tests are hermetic (no network, no real DB required)
