# 6.2.5: Implement structured error handling with MCP error codes

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Task
**Feature:** [6.2: Cross-Cutting Protocol Features](./6.2-protocol-features.md)
**Tags:** `+protocol`

---

- [ ] Map application errors to MCP error codes:
  - Authorization failures → appropriate permission error
  - Validation failures → invalid params
  - Not found → resource not found
  - Server errors → internal error
- [ ] Include human-readable error messages in all error responses
- [ ] Include error details for debugging in development mode only
- [ ] Never leak sensitive information in error responses

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every error path returns a structured MCP error with the correct code
- [ ] Error messages are human-readable and actionable
- [ ] Development mode includes stack trace / detail; production does not
- [ ] Authorization errors do not reveal whether a resource exists
