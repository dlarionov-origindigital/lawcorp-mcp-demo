# 5.2.3: Conflict detection enhancement sampling

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [5.2: Sampling](./5.2-sampling.md)
**Tags:** `+sampling` `+intake`

As the MCP server,
I want to use LLM reasoning to identify non-obvious conflicts from entity relationships,
So that the conflict check catches indirect conflicts that string matching would miss.

- [ ] Trigger: after `intake_run_conflict_check` completes its database search
- [ ] Pass conflict check results to `sampling/createMessage` for reasoning
- [ ] LLM identifies relationship chains (e.g., subsidiary of a conflicted party)
- [ ] Enhanced results added to ConflictCheck record

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Enhanced check runs after the database search phase completes
- [ ] LLM-identified potential conflicts are flagged as `PotentialConflict` with reasoning notes
- [ ] Sampling failure falls back to the database-only results
