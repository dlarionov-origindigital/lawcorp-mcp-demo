As an attorney,
I want a prompt that generates a structured case summary tailored to a specific audience,
So that I can quickly produce partner briefings, client updates, or court summaries.

- [ ] Arguments: `caseId`, `audience` (Partner, Client, Court)
- [ ] Audience drives tone and detail level: Partner = detailed/technical, Client = plain language, Court = formal
- [ ] Embed case timeline, team, status, and key facts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Partner summary includes billing status and strategic notes
- [ ] Client summary omits privileged attorney notes
- [ ] Court summary uses formal legal tone
