**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [5.2: Sampling](./5.2-sampling.md)
**Tags:** `+sampling` `+calendar`

As the MCP server,
I want to parse uploaded documents and extract key dates and deadlines,
So that the calendar is populated automatically from legal documents.

- [ ] Trigger: after a document is created with DocumentType = Contract or Motion
- [ ] Call `sampling/createMessage` with document content to extract dates and their significance
- [ ] Create Deadline entities for each extracted date

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Extracted dates are created as Deadline entities linked to the case
- [ ] Each deadline has a human-readable title derived from the document context
- [ ] Sampling failure does not prevent document creation
