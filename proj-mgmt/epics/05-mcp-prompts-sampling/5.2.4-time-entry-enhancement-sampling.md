# 5.2.4: Time entry description enhancement sampling

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [5.2: Sampling](./5.2-sampling.md)
**Tags:** `+sampling` `+billing`

---

As the MCP server,
I want to improve time entry descriptions for billing compliance,
So that vague entries are enriched with case context before being submitted.

- [ ] Trigger: when `time_entries_log` is called with a short or vague description (< 20 chars)
- [ ] Call `sampling/createMessage` with the case context and original description
- [ ] Suggest an improved description to the user before saving

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Enhancement is suggested, not auto-applied — user confirms or rejects
- [ ] Enhancement includes matter context and work type
- [ ] Sampling failure saves the original description without error
