As an M&A attorney,
I want a prompt that compares terms across multiple deal documents,
So that I can identify discrepancies and negotiation gaps efficiently.

- [ ] Arguments: `documentIds` (array), `comparisonAreas`
- [ ] Fetch all specified documents and embed content
- [ ] comparisonAreas drives which clauses to compare (e.g., representations, indemnification, closing conditions)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Output is a structured comparison table per comparisonArea
- [ ] Discrepancies between documents are highlighted
