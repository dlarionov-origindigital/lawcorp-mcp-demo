# 5.2.1: Document classification sampling

As the MCP server,
I want to automatically classify uploaded documents by type,
So that DocumentType is set accurately without requiring manual selection.

- [ ] Trigger: `documents_draft` or a new `documents_upload` tool when DocumentType is not specified
- [ ] Call `sampling/createMessage` with document title + content snippet
- [ ] Parse classification response and set DocumentType on the created Document

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Classification runs when DocumentType is omitted
- [ ] If classification confidence is low, return the suggested type for user confirmation rather than auto-applying
- [ ] Sampling failure sets DocumentType to null and proceeds without error
