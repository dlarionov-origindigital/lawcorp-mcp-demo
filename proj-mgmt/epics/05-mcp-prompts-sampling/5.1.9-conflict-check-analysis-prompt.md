As a partner,
I want a prompt that analyzes conflict check results and recommends next steps,
So that I can make an informed intake decision quickly.

- [ ] Arguments: `intakeRequestId`
- [ ] Fetch intake request and associated ConflictCheck records
- [ ] Summarize conflicts found, assess severity, recommend: approve, investigate further, or decline

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Output clearly distinguishes definite conflicts from potential conflicts
- [ ] Recommendation is actionable (approve / investigate / decline with reasoning)
