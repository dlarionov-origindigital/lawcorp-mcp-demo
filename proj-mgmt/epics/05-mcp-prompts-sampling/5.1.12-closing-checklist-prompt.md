As an M&A attorney,
I want a prompt that generates a closing checklist for a transaction,
So that nothing is missed in the final stages of a deal.

- [ ] Arguments: `caseId`, `closingDate`, `dealType`
- [ ] dealType drives checklist sections (deliverables, consents, conditions)
- [ ] closingDate drives urgency flags on outstanding items

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Checklist is organized by closing deliverable category
- [ ] Items with deadlines before closingDate are flagged as urgent
