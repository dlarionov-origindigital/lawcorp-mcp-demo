As an M&A attorney,
I want a prompt that generates a due diligence checklist for a transaction,
So that I don't miss critical review areas for a specific deal type.

- [ ] Arguments: `caseId`, `dealType` (Asset Purchase, Stock Purchase, Merger)
- [ ] dealType drives the checklist sections (e.g., Stock Purchase adds capitalization table review)
- [ ] Embed transaction parties and estimated value from case

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Checklist sections vary meaningfully by dealType
- [ ] Output is in a structured checklist format the attorney can action directly
