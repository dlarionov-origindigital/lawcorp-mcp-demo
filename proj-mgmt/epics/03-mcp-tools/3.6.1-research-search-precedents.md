As an attorney,
I want to search case law precedents by topic, jurisdiction, and date range,
So that I can find supporting authority for my arguments.

- [ ] Parameters: `query`, `jurisdiction?`, `dateFrom?`, `dateTo?`, `practiceArea?`
- [ ] Search mock precedent data (ResearchMemo content + tags as a proxy for precedents)
- [ ] Return structured results with citations, jurisdiction, and relevance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All optional filters work independently and in combination
- [ ] Results include jurisdiction and a snippet of relevant text
