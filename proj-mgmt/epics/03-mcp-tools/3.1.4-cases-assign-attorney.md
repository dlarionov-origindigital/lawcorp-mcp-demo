# 3.1.4: Implement `cases_assign_attorney` tool

**Status:** DONE
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [3.1: Case Management Tools](./3.1-case-management-tools.md)
**Tags:** `+case-mgmt`

---

As a partner,
I want to assign or reassign attorneys to cases,
So that case teams are properly staffed.

- [x] Parameters: `caseId`, `attorneyId`, `role` (Lead/Supporting/Reviewer)
- [x] Partner-only authorization
- [x] Validate attorney exists and IsActive = true
- [x] Create or update CaseAssignment (idempotent — reassigns if already assigned)
- [x] Create CaseEvent of type Assignment
- [x] Write to audit log

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Non-partner callers receive an error message
- [x] Assigning an inactive attorney is rejected
- [x] A CaseEvent is created for every assignment or reassignment
