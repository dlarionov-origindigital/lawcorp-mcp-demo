As an attorney,
I want to add hearings, deadlines, and meetings through the AI assistant,
So that my calendar stays up to date without switching to another app.

- [ ] Parameters: `caseId`, `eventType` (Hearing/Deadline/Meeting), `title`, `dateTime`, `attendees?`, `notes?`
- [ ] Create the appropriate entity: Hearing, Deadline, or CaseEvent
- [ ] Associate with the case
- [ ] Validate case access for the caller

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hearing type creates a Hearing entity and links to a court (prompt for court if not specified)
- [ ] Deadline type creates a Deadline entity with Normal urgency as default
- [ ] Invalid eventType returns a clear error
