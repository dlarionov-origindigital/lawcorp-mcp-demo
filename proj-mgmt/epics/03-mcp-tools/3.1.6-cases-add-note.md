# 3.1.6: Implement `cases_add_note` tool

**Status:** DONE
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [3.1: Case Management Tools](./3.1-case-management-tools.md)
**Tags:** `+case-mgmt`

---

As an attorney or paralegal,
I want to add notes to a case,
So that observations and updates are captured in the case record.

- [x] Parameters: `caseId`, `content`, `isPrivileged?`
- [x] Privileged notes visible only to attorneys (title convention: `[PRIVILEGED] Note`)
- [x] Create CaseEvent of type Note
- [x] Write to audit log

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Note is stored as a CaseEvent with correct EventType
- [x] Privileged notes do not appear in timeline for non-attorney callers
- [ ] Paralegals can add non-privileged notes; interns cannot — deferred to Epic 1.3 when IUserContext gains Paralegal/Intern role support
