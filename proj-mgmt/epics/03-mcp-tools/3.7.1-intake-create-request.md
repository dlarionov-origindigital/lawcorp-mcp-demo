**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [3.7: Intake & Onboarding Tools](./3.7-intake-tools.md)
**Tags:** `+intake`

---

As a paralegal or associate,
I want to create a new client intake request,
So that potential new clients are properly evaluated before the firm commits.

- [ ] Parameters: `clientName`, `contactInfo`, `matterDescription`, `practiceGroup`, `referralSource?`
- [ ] Create IntakeRequest with Status = Pending
- [ ] Emit a CaseEvent or notification to trigger conflict check workflow

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] IntakeRequest is created with correct PracticeGroupId resolved from practiceGroup name
- [ ] Unknown practiceGroup name returns a clear validation error
- [ ] Created request is retrievable via `intake_get_request`
