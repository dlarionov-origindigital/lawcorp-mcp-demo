**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [3.3: Client & Contact Management Tools](./3.3-client-contact-tools.md)
**Tags:** `+client-mgmt`

---

As an attorney,
I want to search and retrieve client profiles,
So that I can access client information and engagement history in my conversation.

**`clients_search`:**
- [ ] Parameters: `query`, `clientType?` (Individual/Organization), `industry?`
- [ ] Role-based filtering applies

**`clients_get`:**
- [ ] Parameters: `clientId`
- [ ] Return full client profile with engagement history and associated cases

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Search matches on Name, Industry, and ContactEmail
- [ ] clientType and industry filters work independently and together
- [ ] `clients_get` returns associated cases (respecting caller's case-level access)
