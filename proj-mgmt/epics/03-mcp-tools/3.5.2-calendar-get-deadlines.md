**Tags:** `+calendar`

As an attorney,
I want to see filing deadlines and statute of limitations dates,
So that I never miss a critical deadline.

- [ ] Parameters: `caseId?`, `attorneyId?`, `urgency?` (Critical/High/Normal)
- [ ] Sort by urgency (Critical → High → Normal), then by DueDate ascending
- [ ] Flag overdue deadlines (DueDate < today and CompletedDate is null)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Overdue deadlines are clearly indicated in the response
- [ ] Urgency filter restricts to the specified level only
- [ ] CompletedDate non-null deadlines are excluded by default
