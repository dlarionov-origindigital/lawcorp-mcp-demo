As an attorney,
I want to log billable and non-billable time via the AI assistant,
So that I can track my time without switching applications.

- [ ] Parameters: `attorneyId`, `caseId`, `hours`, `description`, `date`, `billable`
- [ ] Associates can only log their own time; partners can log for anyone in their practice group
- [ ] Default BillableRate from the attorney's HourlyRate
- [ ] Validate: hours > 0, case exists and caller has access

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Associate attempting to log for another attorney receives 403
- [ ] hours ≤ 0 is rejected with a descriptive validation error
- [ ] TimeEntry is created with correct BillableRate defaulted from attorney record
- [ ] Status defaults to Draft
