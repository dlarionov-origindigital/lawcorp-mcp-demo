**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [3.6: Legal Research Tools](./3.6-research-tools.md)
**Tags:** `+research`

---

As an attorney or intern,
I want to create, retrieve, and search research memos,
So that research findings are captured and reusable across matters.

**`research_get_memo`:**
- [ ] Parameters: `memoId`

**`research_create_memo`:**
- [ ] Parameters: `caseId`, `topic`, `findings`, `authorId`
- [ ] Creates a ResearchMemo linked to the case

**`research_search_memos`:**
- [ ] Parameters: `query`, `caseId?`, `authorId?`, `page?`, `pageSize?`
- [ ] Full-text search over Topic, Findings, and Tags

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Created memo appears in search results immediately
- [ ] Interns can create memos but cannot view privileged case memos
- [ ] Pagination applied to `research_search_memos`
