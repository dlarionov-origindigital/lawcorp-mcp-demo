**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [3.7: Intake & Onboarding Tools](./3.7-intake-tools.md)
**Tags:** `+intake`

---

As a partner,
I want to approve or reject intake requests,
So that only properly vetted clients are onboarded.

- [ ] Parameters: `requestId`, `assignedPartnerId`, `notes?`
- [ ] Partner-only authorization
- [ ] On approval: update IntakeRequest status to Approved; optionally create Client entity if new
- [ ] On rejection: update status to Rejected with notes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Non-partner callers receive 403
- [ ] Approved request allows proceeding to engagement letter generation
- [ ] Rejection reason is stored in ReviewedBy and notes fields
