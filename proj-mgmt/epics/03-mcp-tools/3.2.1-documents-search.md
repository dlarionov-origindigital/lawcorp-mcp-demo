**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [3.2: Document Management Tools](./3.2-document-tools.md)
**Tags:** `+doc-mgmt`

---

As an attorney,
I want to search documents by keyword, type, case, and author across the DMS,
So that I can find specific documents without leaving my conversation.

- [ ] Parameters: `query`, `documentType?`, `caseId?`, `authorId?`, `page?`, `pageSize?`
- [ ] Apply role-based filtering (associates see assigned cases only)
- [ ] Support cursor-based pagination

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Full-text search over Title and Content fields
- [ ] All optional filters work independently and in combination
- [ ] Pagination returns `results`, `nextCursor`, `hasMore`, `totalCount`
