**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [3.1: Case Management Tools](./3.1-case-management-tools.md)
**Tags:** `+case-mgmt`

---

As an attorney using an AI assistant,
I want to search cases by keyword, status, practice group, assigned attorney, and date range,
So that I can quickly find relevant cases without leaving my conversation.

- [ ] Implement MCP tool handler for `cases_search`
- [ ] Parameters: `query`, `status?`, `practiceGroup?`, `assignedTo?`, `dateFrom?`, `dateTo?`, `page?`, `pageSize?`
- [ ] Apply role-based row filtering (partners see practice group, associates see assigned only)
- [ ] Support cursor-based pagination
- [ ] Return structured case summary results

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tool is registered and responds to `cases_search` invocations
- [ ] Role-based row filtering is applied correctly
- [ ] Cursor-based pagination returns `results`, `nextCursor`, `hasMore`, `totalCount`

## Notes

Pagination is standardized in Epic 6 (6.2.2).
