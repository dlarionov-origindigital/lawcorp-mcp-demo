# 3.1.1: Implement `cases_search` tool

**Status:** DONE
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [3.1: Case Management Tools](./3.1-case-management-tools.md)
**Tags:** `+case-mgmt`

---

As an attorney using an AI assistant,
I want to search cases by keyword, status, practice group, assigned attorney, and date range,
So that I can quickly find relevant cases without leaving my conversation.

- [x] Implement MCP tool handler for `cases_search`
- [x] Parameters: `query`, `status?`, `practiceGroup?`, `assignedTo?`, `dateFrom?`, `dateTo?`, `page?`, `pageSize?`
- [x] Apply role-based row filtering (partners see all cases, associates see assigned only)
- [x] Page-based pagination with `results`, `page`, `pageSize`, `totalCount`, `hasMore`
- [x] Return structured case summary results

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Tool is registered and responds to `cases_search` invocations
- [x] Role-based row filtering is applied correctly
- [x] Paginated results return `results`, `hasMore`, `totalCount`

## Notes

Uses page-based pagination for now. Cursor-based pagination standardised in Epic 6 (6.2.2).
