**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [3.3: Client & Contact Management Tools](./3.3-client-contact-tools.md)
**Tags:** `+client-mgmt`

---

As a partner evaluating a potential engagement,
I want to run a conflict-of-interest check against existing firm relationships,
So that the firm avoids ethical violations before onboarding a new client.

- [ ] Parameters: `clientName`, `opposingParties` (JSON array), `relatedEntities?` (JSON array)
- [ ] Search existing Clients, Cases (parties and opposing counsel), and Contacts for name matches
- [ ] Return potential conflicts with match type and confidence
- [ ] Support MCP progress reporting (long-running)
- [ ] This is a compliance-critical tool — results must be thorough

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Searches Clients, CaseParties, OpposingCounsel, and Contacts
- [ ] Returns structured conflict results: entity type, matched name, case/client context
- [ ] Progress updates emitted at each search phase
- [ ] Empty result (clear) is explicitly indicated, not just an empty array
