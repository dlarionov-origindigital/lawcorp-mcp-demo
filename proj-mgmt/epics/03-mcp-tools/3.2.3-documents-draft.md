As an attorney or paralegal,
I want to generate a draft document from a standard template,
So that I can quickly produce legal documents without starting from scratch.

- [ ] Parameters: `templateType`, `caseId`, `parameters` (JSON object)
- [ ] Look up template by type (EngagementLetter, NDA, MergerAgreement, BoardResolution, Motion, Brief)
- [ ] Populate template with case and client data
- [ ] Create Document entity with Status = Draft, associated with the case
- [ ] Return the generated document

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unknown templateType returns a clear error listing valid types
- [ ] Generated document is persisted and has a valid document ID
- [ ] Caller must have access to the target case
- [ ] Document appears in `documents_list_by_case` after creation
