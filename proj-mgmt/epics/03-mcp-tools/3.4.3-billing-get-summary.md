As a partner,
I want to see a billing summary for a case or client,
So that I can monitor financial health and budget adherence.

- [ ] Parameters: `caseId?`, `clientId?`, `dateFrom?`, `dateTo?`
- [ ] Aggregate: total hours, total billed amount, total outstanding, approved vs draft entries
- [ ] Partners and associates on assigned cases can access

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least one of `caseId` or `clientId` must be provided
- [ ] Summary correctly aggregates only Approved and Billed time entries for billed total
- [ ] Associates only see summaries for their assigned cases
