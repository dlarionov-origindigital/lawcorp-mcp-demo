As an attorney,
I want to see a chronological timeline of all case events,
So that I can understand case history at a glance.

- [x] Parameters: `caseId`, `eventType?`
- [x] Return CaseEvents ordered by EventDate ascending
- [x] Optionally filter by EventType (StatusChange, Assignment, Note, Filing, Hearing, etc.)
- [x] Enforce case-level authorization
- [x] Privileged notes (title starts with "[PRIVILEGED]") hidden from non-attorneys

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Events are returned in chronological order
- [x] eventType filter correctly limits results
- [x] Privileged notes hidden when caller is not an attorney
