As an attorney,
I want to see a chronological timeline of all case events,
So that I can understand case history at a glance.

- [ ] Parameters: `caseId`, `eventType?`
- [ ] Return CaseEvents ordered by EventDate ascending
- [ ] Optionally filter by EventType (StatusChange, Assignment, Note, Filing, Hearing, etc.)
- [ ] Enforce case-level authorization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Events are returned in chronological order
- [ ] eventType filter correctly limits results
- [ ] Privileged notes are hidden from paralegals and interns
