# 3.1.2: Implement `cases_get` tool

**Status:** DONE
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [3.1: Case Management Tools](./3.1-case-management-tools.md)
**Tags:** `+case-mgmt`

As an attorney,
I want to retrieve full case details by ID,
So that I can get comprehensive case context in my AI conversation.

- [x] Parameters: `caseId`
- [x] Return full case details: parties, team, status, dates, estimated value, practice group
- [x] Enforce authorization (user must have access to this case)
- [ ] Redact privileged fields for intern role — deferred until IUserContext includes Intern role

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Returns complete case object including assignments, parties, and key dates
- [x] Returns error if caller does not have access to the case
- [ ] Intern role receives redacted version — deferred to Epic 1.3

## Notes

Intern field redaction deferred to Epic 1.3 (Custom Authorization Layer) when role granularity is added to IUserContext.
