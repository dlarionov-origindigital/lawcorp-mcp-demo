As a Law-Corp user,
I want to browse MCP resources by URI and view their content,
So that I can see firm data, case details, and reference material through the web app.

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Create a `Resources.razor` page at `/resources`
- [ ] Call `IMcpClientService.ListResourcesAsync()` on page load and display available resources grouped by category (static vs. dynamic)
- [ ] For static resources: show the URI and description; clicking reads the resource and displays its content
- [ ] For dynamic resources (URI templates): show a form that fills in the template parameters (e.g., `caseId` for `lawcorp://cases/{caseId}`)
- [ ] Display resource content in a read-only panel with appropriate formatting (JSON, text, markdown)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Static resources are listed and readable
- [ ] Dynamic resource URI templates render parameter forms
- [ ] Resource content is displayed correctly after reading
- [ ] Authorization-denied resources show a clear error message
