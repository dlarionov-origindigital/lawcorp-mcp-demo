# 8.6: Header Links

**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Epic:** [Epic 8: Web Application](../_epic.md)
**Goal:** Deliver a functional, well-tested header bar whose links always work correctly in both authenticated and unauthenticated states.

## Context

The header is the primary navigation chrome visible on every page. Its links must adapt to the current auth mode (`UseAuth` on/off) and authentication state (signed-in vs anonymous). This feature tracks all header link behaviours and their E2E test coverage.

## Items

| ID | Title | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [8.6.1](./8.6.1-sign-in-link-navigation.md) | Sign-in link navigates to authentication | Story | IN PROGRESS |
| [BUG-001](./BUG-001-sign-in-link-404.md) | Sign-in link returns 404 when UseAuth=false | Bug | FIXED |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All header links resolve to valid routes in both auth modes
- [ ] Playwright E2E tests cover header link navigation
- [ ] No dead links visible to the user in any configuration
