Create a persistent UI panel that displays the current user's resolved identity, making the identity passthrough visible at all times.

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Create an `IdentityPanel.razor` component that displays:
  - Display name and email (from OIDC claims)
  - Attorney role (from the `roles` claim)
  - Practice group
  - Case assignments (list of assigned case IDs/names)
  - Token expiration time (countdown)
- [ ] Fetch the identity details from the MCP server or resolve them client-side from the JWT claims
- [ ] Place the panel in a persistent location (sidebar, collapsible drawer, or header dropdown)
- [ ] Highlight role-specific styling (e.g., Partner = gold accent, Intern = muted accent) to visually differentiate personas during demos

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The panel shows the current user's full identity context
- [ ] Switching personas (logging out and in as a different user) updates the panel
- [ ] The panel is visible on all pages without obstructing the main content
- [ ] Token expiration is shown so the tester knows when re-auth is needed
