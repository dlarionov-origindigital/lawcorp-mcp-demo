# 8.3: Authorization Audit & Observability

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Epic:** [Epic 8: Web Application](./_epic.md)
**Goal:** Provide UI surfaces that make the identity passthrough architecture visible — showing the authenticated identity, the MCP request/response trace, and the authorization decisions made by the server — so that developers and stakeholders can see exactly what's happening under the hood.

## Items

| ID | Title | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [8.3.1](./8.3.1-identity-context-display.md) | Identity context display panel | Task | BACKLOG |
| [8.3.2](./8.3.2-mcp-message-trace-viewer.md) | MCP message trace viewer (JSON-RPC debug) | Story | BACKLOG |
| [8.3.3](./8.3.3-auth-decision-log.md) | Authorization decision log viewer | Story | BACKLOG |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The current user's identity (name, role, practice group, case assignments) is always visible
- [ ] Every MCP JSON-RPC request and response is captured and displayed in a debug panel
- [ ] Authorization decisions (granted/denied, with reason) from the MCP server are surfaced in the UI
- [ ] The audit trail is clear enough that a non-developer can understand "why did this user see these results?"

## Dependencies

- 8.1 (project foundation) and 8.2 (MCP client) — the app must be running and connected
- 1.3.4 (audit logging) — server-side audit log must emit structured entries
