# 8.1.4: App registration and redirect URI configuration

**Status:** DONE
**Type:** Task
**Feature:** [8.1: Blazor Project Foundation](./8.1-blazor-project-foundation.md)
**Tags:** `+web-app` `+auth`

---

Configure the Entra ID app registration to support the Blazor web app's OIDC redirect flow, either by creating a new app registration or adding a redirect URI to the existing MCP server registration.

## Implementation Steps

- [x] Decide: single multi-platform app registration (shared with MCP server) or separate registration for the web app
  - **Decision:** Shared registration — both the web app and MCP server use the same ClientId (see `appsettings.Development.json`)
- [x] If shared registration:
  - Add the redirect URI `https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc` to the existing `LawCorp MCP Server` registration
  - Add the front-channel logout URL
- [x] Assign all six persona users to the web app registration (same role assignments as the MCP server)
- [x] Update [docs/auth-config.md](../../../docs/auth-config.md) with the new registration steps (Step 10)
- [ ] Update [1.2.3 app registrations docs](../01-foundation/1.2.3-app-registrations-docs.md) cross-reference

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The web app can complete the OIDC redirect flow against Entra ID
- [x] The acquired token's `aud` claim matches `api://<MCP-server-client-id>` (for OBO to MCP server) or the web app's own client ID (depending on registration strategy)
- [x] All six personas can log in to the web app
- [x] Documentation is updated with the new redirect URI and registration steps
