# 8.2: MCP Client Integration

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Epic:** [Epic 8: Web Application](./_epic.md)
**Goal:** Connect the Blazor web app to the Law-Corp MCP server using the C# MCP SDK's `HttpClientTransport`, passing the authenticated user's token on every request, and provide UI surfaces for tools, resources, and prompts.

## Items

| ID | Title | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [8.2.1](./8.2.1-mcp-client-service.md) | MCP client service with HttpClientTransport | Story | BACKLOG |
| [8.2.2](./8.2.2-session-token-passthrough.md) | Per-session MCP client with user token passthrough | Task | BACKLOG |
| [8.2.3](./8.2.3-tool-invocation-ui.md) | Tool discovery and invocation UI | Story | BACKLOG |
| [8.2.4](./8.2.4-resource-browser-ui.md) | Resource browser UI | Story | BACKLOG |
| [8.2.5](./8.2.5-prompt-template-ui.md) | Prompt template UI | Story | BACKLOG |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The Blazor app connects to the MCP server via `HttpClientTransport` with the user's Bearer token
- [ ] Tool list is discovered dynamically from the MCP server's `tools/list` response
- [ ] Users can select a tool, fill in parameters, invoke it, and see results
- [ ] Resources are browsable via URI templates
- [ ] Prompt templates are listable and usable
- [ ] MCP client connection is scoped per user session — each user's token is isolated

## Dependencies

- 8.1 (Blazor project foundation) — project must exist and auth must work
- Epic 3 (MCP tools) — at least some tools must be implemented to exercise the UI
