- [x] `CaseGenerator.cs` — cases with parties, assignments, realistic date ranges
- [x] `DocumentGenerator.cs` — documents per case using type-appropriate content
- [x] `TimeEntryGenerator.cs` — billing following realistic patterns (associates > partners hours)
- [x] `InvoiceGenerator.cs` — invoices with line items from time entries
- [x] `CalendarGenerator.cs` — hearings and deadlines relative to case dates
- [x] `ResearchGenerator.cs` — research memos linked to cases
- [x] `IntakeGenerator.cs` — intake requests with conflict checks

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All 10 generator files exist in the Generators/ folder
