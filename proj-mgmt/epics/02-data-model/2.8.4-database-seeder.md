# 2.8.4: Build database seeder and integrate with EF Core

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Task
**Feature:** [2.8: Mock Data Generator](./2.8-mock-data-generator.md)
**Tags:** `+mock-data`

---

- [ ] Implement `MockDataSeeder` that orchestrates all generators
- [ ] Wire into EF Core `DbContext.OnModelCreating` or a standalone seed command
- [ ] Support `dotnet run --seed` or a separate CLI command
- [ ] Ensure idempotent seeding (can re-run without duplicates)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Medium profile seeds ~80 attorneys, ~150 cases, with realistic related data
- [ ] Seed is deterministic — same seed produces same data
- [ ] Seeding completes in < 30 seconds for medium profile

## Notes

Code exists but cannot be run without database migrations (blocked on 2.7.2). Unblock by completing 2.7.2 first.
