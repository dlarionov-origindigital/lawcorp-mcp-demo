As an AI assistant,
I want to resolve client and attorney URIs for profile data,
So that I can surface rich context about people and relationships.

| URI Template | Description |
|---|---|
| `lawcorp://clients/{clientId}` | Client profile and matter history |
| `lawcorp://clients/{clientId}/cases` | All cases for a client |
| `lawcorp://attorneys/{attorneyId}` | Attorney profile, caseload, availability |
| `lawcorp://attorneys/{attorneyId}/timesheet` | Current period timesheet |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `attorneys/{attorneyId}/timesheet` returns entries for the current billing period only
- [ ] `clients/{clientId}/cases` respects the caller's case-level access
