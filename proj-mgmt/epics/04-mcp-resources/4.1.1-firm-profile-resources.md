# 4.1.1: Implement firm profile and directory resources

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [4.1: Static Resources](./4.1-static-resources.md)
**Tags:** `+resources`

As an AI assistant,
I want access to firm reference data,
So that I can provide contextual answers about the firm's structure and people.

| URI | Description |
|---|---|
| `lawcorp://firm/profile` | Firm profile, practice groups, office information |
| `lawcorp://firm/attorneys` | Full attorney directory with roles and practice groups |
| `lawcorp://firm/rate-cards` | Standard billing rates by attorney level |

- [ ] Register all three URIs as static MCP resources
- [ ] Attorney directory respects role-based visibility (interns see limited info)
- [ ] Rate cards grouped by AttorneyRole

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each URI resolves and returns well-structured JSON
- [ ] `lawcorp://firm/attorneys` omits inactive attorneys
- [ ] `lawcorp://firm/rate-cards` returns rates for Partner, Associate, and OfCounsel
