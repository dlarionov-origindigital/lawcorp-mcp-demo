# 4.1.2: Implement reference data resources

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [4.1: Static Resources](./4.1-static-resources.md)
**Tags:** `+resources`

As an AI assistant,
I want access to reference enumerations and templates,
So that I can validate inputs and guide users through workflows.

| URI | Description |
|---|---|
| `lawcorp://reference/document-templates` | Available document templates and their parameters |
| `lawcorp://reference/case-statuses` | Valid case statuses and allowed transitions |
| `lawcorp://reference/practice-groups` | Practice group definitions and descriptions |
| `lawcorp://reference/jurisdictions` | Supported jurisdictions and court hierarchies |

- [ ] Register all four URIs as static MCP resources
- [ ] Case statuses resource includes the valid transition graph

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each URI resolves and returns well-structured JSON
- [ ] `case-statuses` includes the transition graph (e.g., Active → [OnHold, Closed, Settled])
