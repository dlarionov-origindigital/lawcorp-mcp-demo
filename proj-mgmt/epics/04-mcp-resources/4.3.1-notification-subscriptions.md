**Status:** BACKLOG
**Type:** Story
**Feature:** [4.3: Subscription Resources](./4.3-subscription-resources.md)
**Tags:** `+resources`

As an attorney,
I want to receive real-time notifications about my cases,
So that I'm immediately aware of critical changes without polling.

| URI | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `lawcorp://notifications/deadlines` | Deadline within 48 hours |
| `lawcorp://notifications/case-updates` | Status transition on assigned cases |
| `lawcorp://notifications/new-assignments` | New case assignment for current user |
| `lawcorp://notifications/billing-alerts` | Invoice overdue or budget > 80% |

- [ ] Implement MCP resource subscription protocol (`resources/subscribe`, `resources/unsubscribe`)
- [ ] Server pushes `notifications/resources/updated` when triggers fire
- [ ] Notifications scoped to authenticated user's assigned cases only

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Subscribe/unsubscribe round-trip works correctly
- [ ] Deadline notification fires for deadlines within 48 hours (checked on a schedule)
- [ ] Billing alert fires when an invoice transitions to Overdue
