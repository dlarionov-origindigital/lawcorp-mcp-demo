# 7.4: Tool E2E Tests

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Epic:** [Epic 7: End-to-End Testing](./_epic.md)
**Goal:** Verify that every MCP tool handler correctly executes its happy path and returns well-formed responses for an authorized persona, and returns the correct error for an unauthorized persona, exercised through the Web API test host.

## Items

| ID | Title | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7.4.1](./7.4.1-case-document-tool-tests.md) | Case management & document tool tests | Story | BACKLOG |
| [7.4.2](./7.4.2-billing-calendar-tool-tests.md) | Billing & calendar tool tests | Story | BACKLOG |
| [7.4.3](./7.4.3-research-intake-tool-tests.md) | Research & intake tool tests | Story | BACKLOG |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every tool from the PRD Section 3.1 tool inventory has at least one happy-path test using an authorized persona
- [ ] Every tool that enforces role restrictions has at least one denied-access test
- [ ] Tool responses are validated against their expected schema (not just HTTP 200)
- [ ] Tests use the `PersonaFixture` dataset (no additional ad-hoc seeding per test unless strictly necessary)

## Dependencies

Depends on: 7.1 (infrastructure), 7.2 (persona fixture), Epic 3 (tools must be implemented)
Blocked until Epic 3 features are IN PROGRESS.
