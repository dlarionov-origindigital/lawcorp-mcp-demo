# 7.2: Persona Fixture

**Status:** BACKLOG
**Epic:** [Epic 7: End-to-End Testing](./_epic.md)
**Goal:** Define a canonical set of six named personas (one per firm role) and a deterministic fixture seeder that creates a minimal, precisely-controlled dataset with known entity relationships, enabling authorization and access-control tests to make exact assertions.

## Items

| ID | Title | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7.2.1](./7.2.1-persona-catalog.md) | Persona catalog | Task | BACKLOG |
| [7.2.2](./7.2.2-fixture-data-seeder.md) | Fixture data seeder | Task | BACKLOG |

## Design Rationale

The `PersonaFixture` is intentionally separate from the full `MockDataSeeder`. The mock seeder generates a large, realistic dataset for exploratory use; the fixture seeder creates a small, named, relationship-explicit dataset for test assertions. The fixture can later be replaced with a randomized but structurally equivalent generator if desired — the adapter pattern in 7.1.1 makes this swap transparent to the test classes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Six personas defined, one per role, with stable IDs
- [ ] Two cases seeded with controlled assignment relationships (see notes below)
- [ ] At least one privileged document exists on a shared case
- [ ] At least one invoice exists that only Partner and above can access
- [ ] Persona IDs in the fixture exactly match the IDs used by `FakeIdentityContext` in 7.1.2
- [ ] Fixture is idempotent — running the seeder twice does not create duplicates

## Controlled Relationship Map

The fixture must establish the following relationships to enable the test scenarios in 7.3 and 7.4:

| Entity | Assigned to | Excluded from |
|---|---|---|
| **Case Alpha** (M&A practice group) | Harvey Specter (Lead), Kim Wexler (Supporting), Erin Brockovich (Paralegal) | Alan Shore, Elle Woods, Vinny Gambini |
| **Case Beta** (M&A practice group) | Harvey Specter (Lead) only | Kim Wexler, Erin Brockovich, Alan Shore, Elle Woods, Vinny Gambini |
| **Case Gamma** (Securities practice group) | Alan Shore (Of Counsel, read) | Harvey Specter, Kim Wexler, Erin Brockovich, Elle Woods, Vinny Gambini |
| **Privileged Document** on Case Alpha | Authored by Harvey Specter, `IsPrivileged=true` | Intern (Vinny Gambini) sees redacted version |
| **Invoice** on Case Alpha | Full access to Harvey Specter | Erin Brockovich, Elle Woods, Vinny Gambini have no access |
| Elle Woods | Legal Assistant assigned to Harvey Specter | Sees only Harvey's cases (Alpha + Beta); no access to Gamma |
| Vinny Gambini | Intern in M&A practice group | Assigned to Case Alpha; sees redacted content |
